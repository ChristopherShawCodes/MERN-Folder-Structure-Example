in NodeJS, we need to be able to pull code from JavaScript files into other JavaScript files
 so a simple script tag will not do any good for us.

To do this, we can use Javascript's built-in tools to import and export between files:

require("./filePathGoesHere") - used to import from different files
module.exports = WhateverYouNeedToExportGoesHere - used to export whatever content you need to export from that file


IMPORTANT NOTES:
You'll notice that we require the string "./my_module". There are 2 things to note here:

There is no .js at the end of the file. The require method automatically looks for JavaScript files, so we don't need to include the .js file extension.
The files app.js and my_module.js are in the same directory. Normally, the require() method looks for node modules that aren't in the same directory as the file that is running; by default, the require() method looks for the modules located in a folder called node_modules. To tell require() to look in the current directory (i.e. the folder that the file is located in) we have to include "./" in front of the file path. "./" (dot-slash) is the file path for the current directory
